Could you create a beautiful, minimalist, and playful single-page web app (HTML/JS/CSS, all in one file, no backend) called **NudgeNest**?
**Requirements:**:
- Home page features a stylish logo/banner with “NudgeNest”.
- Below the logo, include a visually pleasing, well-labeled form for selecting project ideas. The form should have the header: “Want a new idea for web/app development?”
- The form has 4 selectors:
1. **Topic/Theme:** (Options: Web Development [1], Machine Learning/AI [2, inactive/disabled], Automation/Tools [3, inactive/disabled])
2. **Mood/Flavor:** (Options: Practical/Useful [1], Playful/Funny [2])
3. **Complexity/Constraints:** (Options: One-Day Build [1], Multi-Step/Advanced [2], Minimalist (few features/lines of code) [3])
4. **Result:** (Options: Website [1], App [2], Bot/Automation [3], Content (text, art, video) [4])
- All default selectors should have  as the first/default option with value 0.
- When the user selects options and submits (“Choose desired parameters!”), a JavaScript function loads a local JSON database file (with the below format) into SessionStorage (if not already loaded).
- The app then displays a randomly selected idea matching the chosen selectors as a visually appealing card. Each card must include:
- NudgeNest logo/banner
- Header (iname)
- Description (description)
- MVP features (mvp)
- Data format (dformat)
- Build plan (build)
- Nice to have features (nth)
- Topic/Theme (Web Development, Machine Learning/AI, Automation/Tools)
- Mood/Flavor (Practical/Useful or Playful/Funny)
- Complexity/Constraints  (One-Day Build or Multi-Step/Advanced or Minimalist (few features/lines of code))
- Result (Website value or App or Bot/Automation or Content (text, art, video))
- “Next idea” button (shows another random idea matching current filters, without repeating shown ideas in current session)
- “Choose another” button (returns to form view)
App must keep track of already-shown ideas per filter set in the current session, and not repeat. 
If all ideas are exhausted, show a friendly card: “Sorry I am out of ideas at the moment! Come again later!”
All functionality must work offline, and there’s no backend.
Please include code comments, simple CSS for a beautiful playful style, and a sample JSON array of 2-3 idea objects (I'll add the rest).
- The JSON structure in db.json file is:
```json
{
"i_id": <number>,
"iname": "<name>",
"description": "<string>",
"mvp": "<string>",
"dformat": "<string>",
"build": "<string>",
"nth": "<string>",
"topic": <number>,
"mood": <number>,
"complex": <number>,
"result": <number>
}
```
Please output the full HTML file(s) (with inline CSS/JS) for me to download. Be minimalist, playful, and beautiful.
